# Q Learning Algorithm

## AIM
To develop a Python program to find the optimal policy for the given RL environment using Q-Learning and compare the state values with the Monte Carlo method.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
The bandit slippery walk problem is a reinforcement learning problem in which an agent must learn to navigate a 7-state environment in order to reach a goal state. The environment is slippery, so the agent has a chance of moving in the opposite direction of the action it takes.

States

The environment has 7 states:

->Two Terminal States: G: The goal state & H: A hole state.

->Five Transition states / Non-terminal States including S: The starting state.

Actions

The agent can take two actions:

->R: Move right.

->L: Move left.

Transition Probabilities

The transition probabilities for each action are as follows:

->50% chance that the agent moves in the intended direction.

->33.33% chance that the agent stays in its current state.

->16.66% chance that the agent moves in the opposite direction. For example, if the agent is in state S and takes the "R" action, then there is a 50% chance that it will move to state 4, a 33.33% chance that it will stay in state S, and a 16.66% chance that it will move to state 2.

Rewards

The agent receives a reward of +1 for reaching the goal state (G). The agent receives a reward of 0 for all other states.

## Q LEARNING ALGORITHM

1Initialize the Q-values arbitrarily for all state-action pairs.

2Repeat for each episode:

    ->Initialize the starting state.

    ->Repeat for each step of episode:
    
       ->Choose action from state using policy derived from Q (e.g., epsilon-greedy).
       
       ->Take action, observe reward and next state. Choose action from next state using policy derived from Q (e.g., epsilon-greedy).
       
       ->Update Q(s, a) := Q(s, a) + alpha * [R + gamma * Q(s', a') - Q(s, a)]
       
       ->Update the state and action.
       
    ->Until state is terminal.
    
3Until performance converges.

4Return Q.
